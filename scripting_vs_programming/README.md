## scripting vs programming 
scripting is a type of programming
scripting specifically:
  - usually simpler
  - usually to automate simple or routine tasks
  - execution is usually done with an interpreter
  - the development cycle is shorter, length of code and etc
     learning curve, it is usually easier to learn than programming


## Test for argument example:
  ![alt text](image.png)
- to see what the name of the argument is, include an index
  
 ![alt text](image-1.png)
- index ```[0]``` is the first dirc
- to run a python script you type "python" in a terminal when you've cd into the direc you want to work with (this is the interpreter)
- then the name of the file, this is at index ```[0] ```
- then the arguments from the user is at index ```[1]``` and subsequent argument continue to increase by 1
